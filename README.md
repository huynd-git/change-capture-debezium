# CDC with Debezium, PostgreSQL, and Kafka

## Overview
This Python script is designed to generate simulated financial transactions and insert them into a PostgreSQL database. It's beneficial for setting up a test environment for Change Data Capture (CDC) with Debezium. The script uses the faker library to create realistic, yet fictitious, transaction data and inserts it into a PostgreSQL table.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- psycopg2 library
- faker library 
- PostgreSQL server running locally or accessible remotely
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.
